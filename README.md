Nick's Interpreted Computer Script. A flexible computer scripting language implemented using the minimum of code.
By using the minimum of code it takes a minimum of effort to implement the scripting language on multiple platforms.
The language itself is intended to be used as an element of applications to facilitate user scripted control
of the applications. Whilst bearing in mind programming concepts such as object orientation, etc, I don't want this
to be a slave to (m)any paradigms. There are some key concepts I want to acheive:

- Minimum of code to implement
- As fast as it can be given its 'interpreted' nature
- Software re-use - the ability to build components that can be shared between applications
